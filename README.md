<h1>A fully responsive website for a local Waco company.</h1>
<p>The website can be found at this link http://jjspartypacks.com.</p>
<p>JJs Party Packs is a party equipment rental company who was looking for a simple but elegant website to showcase their business. To achieve this I developed a three page website for them which includes a home page, packages page, and a contact us page. The home page highlights past work and displays they are capable of doing. The packages page includes equipment packages they have available and a calculator. The calculator allows customers to estimate the cost for equipment if none of the packages fit their needs. Lastly, the contact page shares the phone numbers of business owners. In the footer I have included links to the pages and links to social media accounts.</p>
